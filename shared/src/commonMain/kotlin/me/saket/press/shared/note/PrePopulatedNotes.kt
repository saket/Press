      |# Welcome to Press
      |Press is a *wysiwyg* writer for crafting notes. It uses markdown for styling and formatting text with a beautiful inline preview. If you’re new to markdown, check out the next note for tips and tricks.
      |
      |Press is currently only available on Android as a proof-of-concept, but the plan is to introduce it to macOS and iOS in the near future using Kotlin Multiplatform. If you’d like to contribute, Press is hosted on Github:

      |Kudos to [Bear](https://bear.app) for being the inspiration behind Press.

      |# Markdown guide
      |Press understands standard markdown syntaxes, including: **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and many more:
      |
      |### Code blocks
      |```
      |fun helloWorld() {
      |  println(""${'"'}
      |    Code blocks are wrapped inside 
      |    three ticks.
      |  ""${'"'})
      |}
      |``` 
      |
      |### Headings
      |Headings start with 1-6 `#` characters at the start of the line. 
      |
      |```
      |# Heading 1
      |## Heading 2
      |### Heading 3
      |#### Heading 4
      |##### Heading 5
      |###### Heading 6
      |```
      |
      |### Links
      |Links use a set of square brackets (`[]`) for describing the link text, followed by regular parentheses (`()`) containing the URL. 
      |
      |[Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/).
      |
      |### Lists
      |Press supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists. Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangeably — as list markers:
      |
      |- National Treasure
      |+ Ghost Rider
      |* Face/Off
      |
      |Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:
      |
      |1. The Last of Us
      |2. Death Stranding
      |3. Cyberpunk 2077
      |
      |### Thematic breaks
      |Lines starting with three asterisks (`*`), hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) are rendered as horizontal rules, a.k.a. “thematic breaks”. 
      |
      |---
      |
      |### Quotes
      |> A paragraph starting with a `>` are rendered as a quote.
